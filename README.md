# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

This application is configured for and ready to be deployed on **Firebase App Hosting**.

Firebase App Hosting is a fully-managed, serverless platform that simplifies the process of deploying and scaling modern web applications. The `apphosting.yaml` file in this project contains the necessary configuration.

While this is a standard Next.js application that can be deployed to other platforms like Vercel or Netlify, using Firebase App Hosting is the most direct and recommended approach for this project.
