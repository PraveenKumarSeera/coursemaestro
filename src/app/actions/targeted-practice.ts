### Let's Review: ${coreConcept}

It looks like you had some trouble with the last assignment, but don't worry, that's a normal part of learning! Let's quickly review the main ideas.

A key principle of **${coreConcept}** is understanding how components interact and manage state. For instance, in React, passing props down and lifting state up is crucial. When working with APIs, it's all about the request/response cycle. Taking a moment to diagram the data flow before coding can be incredibly helpful.

---

### Your Turn: New Practice Problem

Hereâ€™s a small problem to help solidify the concept:

**Question:** Imagine you have a component that needs to fetch user data from an API endpoint \`/api/user/1\`. How would you use the \`useEffect\` hook to fetch this data when the component first renders? Write a small pseudo-code snippet.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

Let's walk through it together.

1.  **Import \`useEffect\` and \`useState\`:** You need these hooks to manage side effects (like fetching data) and to store the data once it arrives.
2.  **Set up State:** Create a state variable to hold the user data, e.g., \`const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\`.
3.  **Create the \`useEffect\` Hook:** Inside the component, call \`useEffect\`. The first argument is a function that will run after the component renders.
4.  **Fetch the Data:** Inside the effect, use \`fetch('/api/user/1')\` to make the request.
5.  **Handle the Response:** Use \`.then(res => res.json())\` to parse the JSON and \`.then(data => setUser(data))\` to update your state.
6.  **Add the Dependency Array:** The second argument to \`useEffect\` should be an empty array (\`[]\`). This tells React to only run the effect once, when the component mounts.

**Pseudo-code:**
\`\`\`javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/user/1')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setUser(data));
}, []); // Empty array means this runs only once.
\`\`\`

Great job working through this! Every attempt is a step forward.
